# Study of classroom ventilation using ceiling fan CFD OpenFOAM

# Introduction
The European HESE study (Health Effects of School Environments [1]) of the World Health Organization (WHO) has demonstrated that indoor air quality (IAQ) in the investigated
schools and classrooms was poor, causing respiratory health effects. Especially after the outbreak of SARS-COV-19 virus it is therefore to supply fresh air to the building and dispose of heat, particles, humidity and other pollutants generated in the classroom. Consequently, the heat released by internal gains (i.e. the occupants and electronic devices) cannot easily be disposed of. Therefore, the air distribution system should be able to efficiently evacuate the old air, and ensure a homogeneous cooling/heating of the occupied zone.
